**LethalLevelLoaderFixed V50**
--

I WILL NOT UPDATE THIS. This is a Reupload.

**Original mod:** *https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/IAmBatby/LethalLevelLoader/*

**Original Description of LethalLevelLoaderFixed**

A simple fork of LethalLevelLoader that *might* fix some issues on map desync that cause poeple to see differents moons on the monitor and cause client to generate the wrong interior map.

Also resolves the issue of configuration duplication

**Disclaimer** : This mod is intended as a temporary solution until the original LethalLevelLoader mod is updated to resolve these issues.

**New Description**

Pineappleguy03 Here! There was this weird LethalLevelLoaderFixed copy that was released by the creator Zhelderon. Unfortunately he never changed ANYTHING about this update for V50 and it got deleted. I am simply here because this fix of a fix mod worked with most interior mods such as Scoopy's Variety Mod, Bozoros,Â Affliction, LCoffice, ETC. So I just wanted to reupload this so that people can use it till Batby creates a proper update for the original LethalLevelLoader. I could not get any form of contact with Zhelderon. And if you see this, just contact me via Discord! (Pineappleguy03). Cheers!

P.S. This mod was released before I think Bathby even started on the update for V50. That's what makes this mod so weird... But it works and I just want people to use it as a alternative.
